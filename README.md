# A Collection of Command-Line Games

Welcome to my collection of command-line games! This repository is a personal project I created to learn and practice different programming languages. Each game is a standalone application built with a specific language.


## 🎮 About This Project

This project includes several classic games, all playable directly from your terminal. The primary goal was to explore the fundamentals and unique features of various programming languages by building small, fun projects.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Each game/language may have a slightly different setup process. (instruction in each game readme file)


### Running the Games

Instructions on how to compile (if necessary) and run each game. (instruction in each game readme file)

## 💡 Project Goals & Learnings

The main goal of this repository was to solidify my understanding of programming concepts by applying them in different languages.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning project, so I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you spot a bug or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue!
